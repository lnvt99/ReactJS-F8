### SPA
- SPA: Single-Page application -> CSR -> Client side rendering
- Modern approach.
- No page reload required during use.
- Faster to use
- Most resources are loaded the first time
- Upload new data only when needed
- Has a separate front-end
- Not as SEO friendly as MPA (SEO)
- Easy code reuse
- Easy mobile app development
- Depends entirely on JavaScript

### MPA
- MPA: Multi-Page application -> SSR -> Server side rendering
- Classic approach.
- Reload the page during use.
- Slower to use
- Always reload the whole page when accessing and redirecting
- More dependent on each other, placed in the same project
